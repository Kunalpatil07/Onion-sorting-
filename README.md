## About The Project  🌱 
*Agriculture* is the Black-bone of Indian economy
as over *75%* of its population is directly or
indirectly engaged in this profession. Onion is important
commercial horticulture crop grown in india.
The production of onion in the country is about *5.5 million* tones. *India* is the second largest
producer of onion in the world, the first being china. 

Onions are kept in cold storage with a dry and well-ventilated atmosphere for a period
ranging from a few weeks to six months before processing. 
During storage they are highly prone to a number of post harvest diseases most due to 
infection & mechanical damage reading during transportation and harvest 

In agricultural field , onion separating and loading operation is very time consuming in 
farming process . Also  more labours are required for onions loading and separating . Hence total cost of
farming is increases. In rural area manual method generally used . But these method have a drawback like 
high manpower increasing cost. Also in conventional method after onions cutting the separating onion with
soil and overall it required more time and manpower. Majority of onion sorting is done by manually .
So this existing system create various issues like subjective grading , tedious work , increase in
selling cost, inconsistencies and low productivity

From this research we are designing and manufacturing a automated system which 
sizes of onion according to our requirement. It also remove the rotten onion , to reduce effort
,time and cost. We design onion sorting machine . In these machine at a few 3 process carried 
out like the soting of onion is done through elevator mechanism by using conveyor belt and removing 
soils and mulch from onions by using blower and by using sensor removing rotten onion with help of
pneumatic actuator and finally separating the different size of onions by using meshing technique 
onions will be sorted in various grades . Afterwards the automatic weighing of onion bag will be done .
It is useful in trade to increase quality of the onions .
### Tech Stack  🔧
In this project we use two Technologies which are  IOT
and Image Processing.

**Image Processing:** Matlab Tool   

**IOT:** MQ135 Sensors
